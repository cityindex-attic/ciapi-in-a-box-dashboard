    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
        The City Index Ltd. Trading API (hereafter referred to as the CIAPI) allows 
        client UI applications to place FX, Spread bet and CFD trades with the City 
        Index backend trading systems over the web.</p>
    <p>
        The CIAPI is composed of two broad areas; both of which can be accessed via 
        HTTPS:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>HTTP web services</li>
        <li>HTTP streaming</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>
        HTTP web services</h3>
    <p>
        Request / response calls, initiated by the client UI application, are handled by 
        the http web services.  These all follow a simplified REST pattern; encoding data in JSON.
    </p>
    <p>
        Typically, requests for information that can be cached (available markets, 
        historical prices, account history) are exposed via HTTP GET requests.&nbsp; 
        Requests that change state (placing a trade, logging on) are performed using 
        HTTP POST.</p>
    <p>
        Nearly all requests are authenticated by including a UserName and Session token 
        in the headers or querystring of the GET / POST.</p>
    <h3>
        HTTP streaming</h3>
    <p>
        Real-time data is delivered from the backend system through the use of long lived or polling HTTP  
        subscriptions to specific channels.</p>
    <p>
        Specifically, streams of real-time data (prices, news headlines, client margin) 
        are exposed using the Lightstreamer protocol.</p>
    <p>
        All streams are authenticated using the same UserName and Session token used for 
        a HTTP webservice call.</p>
    <h3>
        Client libraries</h3>
    <p>
        Most major UI languages have a corresponding client library, that simplifies 
        access to the CIAPI.&nbsp; These handle common operations like serialising JSON 
        to/from native objects, making calls and subscriptions, caching, throttling &amp; 
        logging.</p>
